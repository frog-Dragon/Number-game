# Number-game
A random idea I had for a number guessing game. 
## How to play
When the program is run it will create two text files. The one titled visable is for the user to look at. That is where the numbers to guess are. There is a pattern that if you figure out turns your guess into a 1/4. 
## Changing the dificulty
To make it easier or harder you can change the number of rows and collums, more is harder.
